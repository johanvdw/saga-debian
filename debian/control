Description: System for Automatic Geoscientific Analysis
 SAGA GIS (System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis) is a free and open source 
 geographic information system used for editing and analysing spatial data. Among 
 others the package includes modules for:
 * File access: interfaces to various table, vector, image and grid file formats
 * Filter for grids: gaussian, laplacian, multi direction lee filter
 * Gridding: interpolation from vector data using triangulation, nearest neighbour, inverse distance
 * Geostatistics: residual analysis, ordinary and universal kriging, single and multiple regression analysis, variance analysis.
 * Grid calculator: combine grids through user defined functions
 * Grid discretisation: skeletonisation, segmentation
 * Grid tools: merging, resampling, gaps filling
 * Image classification:cluster analysis, box classification, maximum likelihood, pattern recognition, region growing
 * Projections:various coordinate transformations for vector and grid data (using Proj4 and GeoTrans libraries), georeferencing of grids
 * Simulation of dynamic processes: TOPMODEL, nitrogen distributions, erosion, landscape development
 * Terrain analysis:slope, aspect, curvatures, curvature classification, analytical 
 hillshading, sink eliminition, flow path analysis, catchment delineation, solar radiation, channel lines, relative altitudes
 * Vector tools: polygon intersection, contour lines from grid
