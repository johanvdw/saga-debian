Description: System for Automatic Geoscientific Analysis
 SAGA GIS (System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis) is a geographic
 information system usable for editing and analysing spatial data. Among
 others it includes modules for:
 . 
 * File access: interfaces to various table, vector, image and grid file
   formats.
 * Filter for grids: gaussian, laplacian, multi direction lee filter.
 * Gridding: interpolation from vector data using triangulation, nearest
   neighbour, inverse distance
 * Geostatistics: residual analysis, ordinary and universal kriging,
   single and multiple regression analysis, variance analysis.
 * Grid calculator: combine grids through user defined functions.
 * Grid discretisation: skeletonisation, segmentation.
 * Grid tools: merging, resampling, gaps filling.
 * Image classification:cluster analysis, box classification, maximum
   likelihood, pattern recognition, region growing.
 * Projections:various coordinate transformations for vector and grid
   data (using Proj4 and GeoTrans libraries), georeferencing of grids
 * Simulation of dynamic processes: TOPMODEL, nitrogen distributions,
   erosion, landscape development.
 * Terrain analysis:slope, aspect, curvatures, curvature classification,
   analytical hillshading, sink eliminition, flow path analysis,
   catchment delineation, solar radiation, channel lines, relative
   altitudes.
 * Vector tools: polygon intersection, contour lines from grid.
