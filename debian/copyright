On two places files were removed to adhere to the DFSG:
- the module natural neighbour was removed from libgrid_gridding
  it relied on a non DFSG algorithm (in triangle.c)
  src/modules/grid/grid_gridding/nn/*
- the module fire simulation: src/modules_simulation/fire/*
  it relies on a non DFSG library: libfire  (www.fire.org)
