SAGA Gis for Debian
-------------------

Libraries provided by SAGA Gis can be used by third-parties modules,
but currently change at every new release their APIs. Therefore, third-parties 
source packages should build-depend on libsaga-dev and depend on 
an additional ${saga:Depends} substvar. This will enforce strict package 
dependency on the right library version and prevent obscure failure
due to changes in structures or functions.

Their debian/rules should execute a little debhelper script
named /usr/bin/saga-depends to append required versioned lib dependencies
to their control file before executing dh_shlibdeps. That script is
provided in the libsaga-dev package.
